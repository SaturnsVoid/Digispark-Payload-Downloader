"The Digispark is an Attiny85 based microcontroller development board similar to the Arduino line, only cheaper, smaller, and a bit less powerful. With a whole host of shields to extend its functionality and the ability to use the familiar Arduino IDE the Digispark is a great way to jump into electronics, or perfect for when an Arduino is too big or too much." - From Digistump


Simply edit to download url and change the drop path, compile, copy to Digispark. 
Then everytime you plug in the digispark to a Windows PC it will download and run the PAYLOAD as admin.

The LED on the Digispark will flash when the script is finished.
